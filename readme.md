This addon enables partially sighted users, sighted educators, or developers to track the location of the NVDA
navigator  object and the focused object, by drawing a rectangle around the
specific object.

The following 3 colors are used by this addon:
* Green, to identify the navigator object.
* Red, to identify the focused object.
* Yellow, when navigator object and focused object are overlapping.

To disable object tracking, uninstall the addon.
